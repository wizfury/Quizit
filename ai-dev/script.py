User authentication verifies the identity of users attempting to access the system, typically through passwords or biometric data. Access control mechanisms restrict access to files, directories, and system resources based on user permissions, ensuring that only authorized users can perform specific actions. Additionally, the OS may use encryption to protect sensitive data, both at rest and during transmission. The OS also implements isolation of processes, ensuring that one process cannot interfere with the resources or data of another, thus maintaining system integrity."
